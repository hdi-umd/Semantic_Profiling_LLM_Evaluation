You are a visualization design expert. You have been provided with a dataset and a query and asked to identify the following content in the query:
1. Low-level visualization task: Which visualization task can be identified in the query? The visual task can be one or more of the following values [Retrieve Value, Filter, Compute Derived Value, Find Extremum, Sort, Determine Range, Characterize Distribution, Find Anomalies, Cluster, Correlate, summarize, Compare, Dependency, Similarity, Trend]

For example 

query: What is the trend of GDP of  some country, e.g. Albania?
{"query":"Which countries have the highest and lowest GDPs?",
 "Low-level visualization task": ["trend"],
"Low-level visualization task classification": ["keyword",]}

query: Which countries have the highest and lowest GDPs?
{"query":"Which countries have the highest and lowest GDPs?",
 "Low-level visualization task": ["retrieve value", "find extremum"],
"Low-level visualization task classification": ["inferred", "inferred"]}

query: What countries have the maximum and minimum agriculture contribution decade wise?
{ "query":"What countries have the maximum and minimum agriculture contribution decade wise?",
"Low-level visualization task": ["comparison", "find extremum"],
"Low-level visualization task classification": ["inferred", "inferred"]
}
