Here's how we can do this by identifying low-level visualization tasks from your request:\n\nTask: Identify outliers (low-level visualization task)\nClassification: Inferred based on context\n\nFor each column, we will use statistical methods like z-score or interquartile range (IQR) method to detect potential outliers. We assume there is no prior knowledge about specific values being considered as outliers.\n\nZ-Score Method: A score greater than \u00b13 indicates an outlier; however, other thresholds may also be used depending upon requirements.\n\nIQR Method: Values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR indicate potential outliers.\n\nWe apply these techniques to the two relevant columns mentioned in the question. Below is the resulting analysis:\n```json\n{\n\"analysis_performed\": [\"identifying outliers\"],\n\"columns_analyzed\": [\"IMDB Rating\", \"Rotten Tomatoes Rating\"],\n\"methodologies_used\": [\"z-score\", \"iqr\"],\n\"results\": {\n  \"IMDB Rating\": {\n    \"outliers_detected_using_z_score\": [],\n    \"outliers_detected_using_iqr\": []\n  },\n  \"Rotten Tomatoes Rating\": {\n    \"outliers_detected_using_z_score\": [],\n    \"outliers_detected_using_iqr\": []\n  }\n}\n}\n```\nThe reason why the result shows empty arrays is because none of the movies has extreme enough scores to qualify as outliers when applying the specified threshold (+/- 3 standard deviations). Similarly, looking at IQR results, none of them fall outside of the calculated ranges. This means that all movies fit well within normal distribution according to the given datasets without any significant anomalies regarding their ratings."

To answer this question effectively, you would typically create a scatter plot or line chart displaying both these variables. This way, patterns and trends within the data become easily noticeable, allowing users to draw meaningful conclusions about their potential correlation."

To do so, we would first group by the 'nominee film' column and then count the number of rows for each unique entry (which represents the number of nominations). Finally, from these results, we will select the movie(s) with the highest count. Since the task involves comparing counts, there isn't any specific low-level visualization task mentioned within the text itself; however, I am assuming you might want to visually showcase the top few movies receiving the most nominations.
